# 2x2x2 Rubik’s Cube Solver 🧊

This Python project solves a 2x2x2 Rubik’s Cube using three algorithms:

- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **A\* (A-star) Search with heuristic**

It includes both a **text-based** cube visualization and an interactive **Pygame GUI** to display the solving process.

## 🔧 Features

- Cube representation with face colors (W, Y, G, B, O, R)
- Scramble function with random moves
- DFS, BFS, and A\* algorithm implementations
- Move tracking and solution steps
- Heuristic-based A\* (mismatched corners)
- Pygame-based cube animation with controls
